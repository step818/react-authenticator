#_SignUp/Login Authenticator_

## Description & Specs

This is a code challenge meant to take 5 basic inputs from a user:
  1. First Name
  2. Last Name
  3. Age
  4. Email address
  5. Password,

and register the user. Then the same user can log-in and the data the user entered will be retrieved. Firebase database and authicator was used for this project. So far, the app doesn't fululy work, but the user can successfully register their email and password, and log back in. Verification is given in the console and also in the backend in firebase.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_**In the command line, you can install npm:*_

### `npm install`

_Installs Node modules needed to run and build the app._

In the command line, you can host locally:

### `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Technologies Used

_Windows 10.1, Visual Studio Code, React, Redux, Axios, Firebase _
